        <p>Sim Local is committed to protecting the privacy and security of your personal information. This privacy notice describes how we collect and use personal information about you during and after your relationship with us.</p>
    
        <p>The privacy notice below explains what information we gather about you, what we use that information for, and to whom we give the information. It also sets out your rights and who you can contact for information or queries.</p>
    
        <p>We respect individuals’ right to privacy and to the protection of personal information.</p>
    
        <p>“Personal Information” means information about a living individual who can be identified from that information (either by itself or when combined with other information).</p>
    
        <h3 class="fw-bold">Sim Local Data Protection Officer</h3>
        <p>Whenever Sim Local collects, uses, or transfers your personal data for its own purposes, Sim Local acts as a data controller of your personal data.</p>
        <p>To better ensure the security of your personal data, Sim Local has appointed a data protection officer (the “DPO”). You may contact the DPO, if you have any questions or concerns regarding this Privacy Policy and how Sim Local processes your personal data, by sending an e-mail to <a href="mailto:dataprotection@simlocal.com">dataprotection@simlocal.com</a>.</p>
    
        <h3 class="fw-bold">What Personal Information Do We Collect?</h3>
        
        <h3 class="fw-bold">Website</h3>
        <p>Sim Local collects your personal data from your use of the Website (e.g., visiting the Website pages, the blog, downloading case studies, watching videos on the Website and viewing infographics provided in the Website), from your subscription to the newsletter or any other e-mailing list, from any request you send through the Website (e.g., completing the sales contact or white paper download form), when you attend a webinar or participate in an online survey or access a whitepaper, or when you attend an investor event or trade show and provide your personal data to us.</p>
        <p>From time to time, Sim Local receives personal data from business partners, vendors, and distributors.</p>
        <p>Sim Local processes the following data that relates to you:</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Connection data (such as IP address, operating system, region and language as well as the date and time the Website was accessed);</li>
            <li>Activity data (such as the number and the Website pages you visited, if you send a request through a form provided by the Website).</li>
        </ul>

        <p>We may also collect and use Aggregated Data such as statistical or demographic data for any purpose.

For example, we may aggregate your usage data to calculate the percentage of users accessing a specific website feature. However, if we combine or connect Aggregated Data with your personal data so that it can directly or indirectly identify you, we treat the combined data as personal data which will be used in accordance with this privacy policy.</p>
        
        <p>We do not collect any Special Categories of Personal Data about you (this includes details about your race or ethnicity, religious or philosophical beliefs, sex life, sexual orientation, political opinions, trade union membership, information about your health, and genetic and biometric data).</p>
        
        <h3 class="fw-bold">Why We Process Your Personal Information?</h3>

            <li>Improve the Website and its features, to better understand how you use the Website;</li>
            <li>Implement marketing activities specific to Sim Local, with respect to e-mailing activities; newsletter; product and/or service information.</li>

        <h3 class="fw-bold">Information Sharing and Disclosure</h3>
        <p>Sim Local will grant access to personal data on a need-to-know basis. Such access will be limited to the portion of the personal data that is necessary to perform the function for which such access is granted.</p>
        <p>Sim Local may need to disclose your personal data to provide you the materials, products, or services you requested through the Website and/or perform any agreement entered with Sim Local (including support services).</p>
        <p>As a result, access to personal data within Sim Local may include its authorised personnel in charge of support, sales, and marketing services.</p>

        <p>Sim Local will also disclose your personal data with your consent, if required to do so by law, to enforce our Terms of Use, in urgent circumstances, or to protect personal safety, the public or our Website.</p>
    
        <h3 class="fw-bold">International Data Transfers</h3>
        <p>Due to the global nature of Sim Local’s business, Sim Local may disclose and transfer certain personal data to a foreign country.</p>
        <p>Regarding EU data subjects:</p>
        <p>Sim Local may transfer your personal data to Sim Local entities and third-party service providers located outside the European Union (“EU”).</p>
